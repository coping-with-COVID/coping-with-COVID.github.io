## Overview

Problem: Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected everybody, causing a lot of pressure, uneasiness, despondency, and inner issues for the understudies alongside their companions and their family.

Solution: I propose to create a mental health chat bot that can give students ease and comfort. Making therapy and relief accessible to all. It will be a safe space where people can openly express themselves without fear of judgment.
