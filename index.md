## Overview

Problem: Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected everybody, causing a lot of pressure, uneasiness, despondency, and inner issues for the understudies alongside their companions and their family.

Solution: We propose to create a mental health chat bot that can give students ease and comfort. Making therapy and relief accessible to all. It will be a safe space where people can openly express themselves without fear of judgment.

## Approach

We want to help students reach out during the COVID-19 pandemic and to cope with the distressing issues they are facing. Students will use the site to vent/talk about their day. To accompish this, our site would suggest a daily topic and users could discuss and share their thoughts around the topic for the day. We would identify keywords students uses in their post and sent out automatic replies that suggest articles or videos that would help comfort the student and make them feel better.

Some mockup pages include:

- Landing page

- Daily discussion Page
- User home page
- FAQ page
- Admin home page
- User profile page

## History

Basically this app will help students cope with distressing issues they are facing. Students will use the bot to vent/talk about their day. The main landing page of the app will contain general information about the chat bot and mental health resources link. How the bot would work would be:

- the bot will prompt a topic for conversation.
  - Ex: “ Pineapple on Pizza? Yay! Or Nay?
- Using follow-ups to facilitate responses.
  - The chat bot will identify keywords students use to suggest articles or videos on how to help comfort the student better.

## Use case ideas

- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
- The Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, can edits site and update chatbot.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, get to home page and goes FAQ to requests ways to improve bot.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, gets to home page, go to Talk to Bot Page can start chat with bot.

## More Advanced Ideas

We are unsure how this can be implemented but down below is ideas we hope can improve the app:
  - Direct access to professionals that can assist student’s mental state
    - It be cool with this could somehow connect with UH’s counseling center
  - Somehow per user have old messages saved. So user can look back at them.
  - Daily check in
    - Ex: Mood Tracker, but there can be a calender will user can see logged mood.
